## Overview
Your task will be to implement app for managing user data. 
(you can find folder `expected-results` to see how view will look like and what you intended to do)

☝️ All have to be written with plain js !!!(**no extra packages etc.**)

index.html is present and styles as well your task is to write script.

NOTE: **In case of any issue DO NOT hasitate contact to me**

## Prerequirments
1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. To start use command: `npm start`
3. Go to browser and open `http://localhost:8081`

## Requirments for app
List of needed features to implement:
1. Showing list of all users.
2. Add ability to create new user via modal (modal is implemented just you have to find way to show/hide it)
3. Add ability to modify user (the same modal as for creating)
4. Removing user
5. In `create/edit modal` list of countries get from data source (could be server or your data store implementation read about it below)

To work with data you have two alternative ways: 
1. (Preferable on this stage )As we didn't work with API before you can import data from file(`homework/resources/data.js`) and work from with that data. 
For this option pls try to manage data with that you have implemented on previous week, class for managing store. 
It will allow you it understands real use case for that. 
2. Get all data from server by making API requests. (We will do it like next iteration)

NOTE: **AS task is reletively time comsuming you can not implemnet all fatures(but preferable to implement all of them)**

NOTE: **no need to rewrite styles, improve view or any other cases, but if you have time and passion you can :)** 

## API description (in case you use server)

**Get single user:** _GET /user?id=user-id_
**Get list of countries:** _GET /countries_

## Development flow
